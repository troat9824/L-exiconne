  ## Installation 
    You will need the following libraries:
    * express
    * path
    * express-session
    * express-handlebars
    * connect-session-sequelize
    * mysql2
    * bcrypt
    * choreographer-js
    * dotenv
    * sequelize

  
  ## Usage 
  You will need a .env to create the lexiconne_db database, a username (root) and password. To initialize, open the CRM and run "mysql -u root -p". Enter your password. Then USE lexiconne_db; . Then source from db/schema.sql. (Occassionally, I have had to source the absolute path.) In your code editor, run "npm run seed" to seed the app. A validation message should appear. Then run "npm start" to start the app.
